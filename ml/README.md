# ML

This is for ML-related training stuff. \
Data is collected from the robot and the model is trained locally, so there is no need for massive amounts of sitting around and doing nothing in the robotics space lol.

## Why I made it

BC i was too lazy to learn how motion profiling works

## Credits

Credits go to [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) for implementing the DDPG algorithm in `trainer.py`
