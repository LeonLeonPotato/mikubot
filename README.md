After the advancements in the space of robotics, with my *Monumental* contributions such as `winter_controller` and `summer_controller`, I have decided, with my genius of a brain, to make a VEX v5 (Pros actually) program to end all VEX v5 programs.

## `./ml/`

Contains stuff related to machine learning, mainly an experiment. (Nothing working has ever come outta there LOL)

## `./src/`

The source code folder. Has a lot of the actual robot code maybe? Who knows.

## `./include/`

Header files. Put yo includes there, including libraries

## Credits

`PROS library` - would not be possible without the epic people at Purdue making the official VEX api obsolete (love you guys mwah <3) \

`Eigen` - Epic cpp numpy makers although not as epic as numpy it is still usable. Epic. \
