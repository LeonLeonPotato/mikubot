# MikuBot

After the advancements in the space of robotics, with my *Monumental* contributions such as `winter_controller` and `summer_controller`, I have decided, with my genius of a brain, to make a VEX v5 program to end all VEX v5 programs.

## `./ml/`

Contains stuff related to machine learning, mainly an experiment.

## `./src/`

The source code folder. You know.

## `./include/`

Header files. Also in there is the PROS library which I am using for this project, and Eigen, which is a matrix math library.
